*This is an ongoing school assignment.

*My learning note for git version controlling:

- Leave a branch open for an as shortest period as possible. Delete the branch when no change making is needed.

- Three level branching: Production (Live), Developement (Test), Feature (Developer's own branch).

- Good practice: pull frequently to keep oneself up-to-date with changes + make and push fast changes

*Progress:

Working on the advance functions
